This IDE is simple and small,only for 545 MB (test on windows11).
This IDE is only for Chinese and only for Windows.
It can help you coding,complete the cpp code and run the code.
We hope this IDE (like its name:"ACcodeIDE") can help you get more AC on Online Judge webpage (such as [Luogu](https://luogu.com),[CodeForces](https://codeforces.com)).
Sadly, this IDE doesn't have some highlight code (QCodeEditor already have highlight code,but for some code change,it doesn't work.we are very sorry about that〒▽〒) but it have auto-tab and bracket completion

Note:This project was developed with the assistance of AI coding tools (such as Qwen and GitHub Copilot) for code completion and suggestions(Maybe over 40%,but never above 70%). All critical logic, architecture design, and debugging were performed by me, and AI-generated content has been manually reviewed to ensure correctness and security.(don't be angry when you see many Chinese notes by AI tools in this project)
